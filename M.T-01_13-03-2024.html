    <h2>This is my First article</h2> 
    <p>According to Islamic beliefs, by fasting in the month of Ramadan, <br>
        the pain and suffering of the poor living in the world is felt by those <br>
         who are more fortunate and blessed. <br>
        Restraint during fasting means keeping one's eyes, nose, ears, <br>
        and tongue under control.</p>
